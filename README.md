# Frigefy project! 

I've created a couple of folders where we can sort all the data we will be using in the projec to have a clear and easy to follow project. 

The assets folder will contain all of the images we plan on using, if we are using any, as well as anything else that is not code.

The components folder will contain all of the custom components that we make, that are specifically for the project.

I have also created a separate UI folder to store all the custom components we make related to the UI, this could be like a `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<Button />`, etc.

There is a hooks folder, in case we want to create a custom hook, for example something like use-http to make API calls, or even a custom hook for firebase stuff.

After this, we have the store, which will be used for redux in order to create all the state we need, and make the slices to create dispatch actions. This will make the project easier to follow !
